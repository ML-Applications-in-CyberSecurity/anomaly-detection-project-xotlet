8080,65494,394,484,TCP,-0.044941482258423426,"Based on the network sensor reading, I would label this anomaly as a **Suspicious TCP Connection**.

The reason for this classification is the unusual combination of values in the reading:

* `src_port`: 8080 is a commonly used port for HTTP proxying or alternative HTTP servers. While not inherently malicious, it's not a typical source port for most applications.
* `dst_port`: 65494 is a high-numbered, ephemeral port, which is unusual for a destination port. Typically, destination ports are well-known ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS) or registered ports (e.g., 3306 for MySQL).
* `packet_size`: 394 bytes is a relatively small packet size, which could indicate a probing or scanning attempt.
* `duration_ms`: 484 milliseconds is a relatively short connection duration, which might suggest a brief, exploratory connection rather than a legitimate data transfer.

The possible cause of this anomaly could be a reconnaissance attack, such as a port scan or a vulnerability scan, where an attacker is attempting to gather information about the network or identify potential weaknesses. The use of an unusual source port and a high-numbered destination port, combined with the small packet size and short connection duration, suggests that this connection may not be part of a legitimate communication."
8080,10631,173,180,TCP,-0.008395655986929373,"Based on the network sensor reading, I would label this anomaly as a **Suspicious TCP Connection**.

The reason for this classification is the unusual combination of source port 8080 and destination port 10631. Port 8080 is commonly used for alternative HTTP traffic, such as proxy servers or web applications. However, it's unusual to see it as the source port in a TCP connection.

Destination port 10631 is not a well-known port and is likely a dynamically assigned port. This, combined with the unusual source port, suggests that this connection might be related to a malicious activity, such as:

1. **Command and Control (C2) communication**: An attacker might be using a compromised system to establish a connection to a command and control server, using an unusual port combination to evade detection.
2. **Data exfiltration**: An attacker might be using this connection to transfer sensitive data out of the network, using an unusual port combination to avoid detection by security systems.
3. **Lateral movement**: An attacker might be using this connection to move laterally within the network, using an unusual port combination to evade detection.

The packet size of 173 bytes and duration of 180 ms are not particularly unusual, but they could be indicative of a slow and steady data transfer, which is often seen in C2 communication or data exfiltration.

Further investigation is necessary to determine the root cause of this anomaly and to take appropriate action to mitigate any potential security risks."
