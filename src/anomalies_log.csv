8080,65494,394,484,TCP,-0.044941482258423426,"Based on the network sensor reading, I would label this anomaly as a **Suspicious TCP Connection**.

The reason for this classification is the unusual combination of values in the reading:

* `src_port`: 8080 is a commonly used port for HTTP proxying or alternative HTTP servers. While not inherently malicious, it's not a typical source port for most applications.
* `dst_port`: 65494 is a high-numbered, ephemeral port, which is unusual for a destination port. Typically, destination ports are well-known ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS) or registered ports (e.g., 3306 for MySQL).
* `packet_size`: 394 bytes is a relatively small packet size, which could indicate a probing or scanning attempt.
* `duration_ms`: 484 milliseconds is a relatively short connection duration, which might suggest a brief, exploratory connection rather than a legitimate data transfer.

The possible cause of this anomaly could be a reconnaissance attack, such as a port scan or a vulnerability scan, where an attacker is attempting to gather information about the network or identify potential weaknesses. The use of an unusual source port and a high-numbered destination port, combined with the small packet size and short connection duration, suggests that this connection may not be part of a legitimate communication."
8080,10631,173,180,TCP,-0.008395655986929373,"Based on the network sensor reading, I would label this anomaly as a **Suspicious TCP Connection**.

The reason for this classification is the unusual combination of source port 8080 and destination port 10631. Port 8080 is commonly used for alternative HTTP traffic, such as proxy servers or web applications. However, it's unusual to see it as the source port in a TCP connection.

Destination port 10631 is not a well-known port and is likely a dynamically assigned port. This, combined with the unusual source port, suggests that this connection might be related to a malicious activity, such as:

1. **Command and Control (C2) communication**: An attacker might be using a compromised system to establish a connection to a command and control server, using an unusual port combination to evade detection.
2. **Data exfiltration**: An attacker might be using this connection to transfer sensitive data out of the network, using an unusual port combination to avoid detection by security systems.
3. **Lateral movement**: An attacker might be using this connection to move laterally within the network, using an unusual port combination to evade detection.

The packet size of 173 bytes and duration of 180 ms are not particularly unusual, but they could be indicative of a slow and steady data transfer, which is often seen in C2 communication or data exfiltration.

Further investigation is necessary to determine the root cause of this anomaly and to take appropriate action to mitigate any potential security risks."
1337,61723,1349,78,TCP,-0.015622093865229836,"**Anomaly Label:** Suspicious Backdoor Activity

**Explanation:** The network sensor reading indicates a potential backdoor activity due to the unusual combination of attributes. Here's why:

* **src_port 1337**: This source port is commonly associated with the ""W32.Blaster.Worm"" malware, which is known to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows operating systems. While it's possible that a legitimate application is using this port, it's unusual and warrants further investigation.
* **dst_port 61723**: This destination port is not a standard port for any well-known service, which suggests that it might be a custom or dynamically assigned port. This could be indicative of a backdoor or Command and Control (C2) communication.
* **packet_size 1349**: The packet size is relatively large, which might indicate that the communication is transferring data or commands, rather than just performing a simple probe or scan.
* **duration_ms 78**: The duration of the connection is relatively short, which could suggest that the communication is intended to be brief and stealthy.

Given these attributes, it's possible that a compromised system on the network is communicating with a malicious actor or a C2 server, potentially exfiltrating data or receiving commands. This anomaly should be investigated further to determine the root cause and prevent potential damage."
443,63334,1474,367,TCP,-0.0075764614841864475,"Based on the network sensor reading, I would label this anomaly as a **Suspicious Outbound Connection**.

The reason for this classification is the unusual destination port number (63334) used in the TCP connection. Typically, well-known services and applications use standardized port numbers below 1024 (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443). The use of a high, non-standard port number like 63334 may indicate a potential malicious activity, such as:

1. **Data exfiltration**: An attacker might be using a non-standard port to transfer sensitive data from the internal network to a command and control (C2) server or a drop zone.
2. **Malware communication**: Malware may use unusual port numbers to communicate with its C2 server, evade detection, or receive instructions.
3. **Unauthorized access**: An unauthorized user or process might be attempting to establish a connection to an unknown or untrusted external entity.

The packet size (1474) and duration (367 ms) are within normal ranges, but the unusual destination port number warrants further investigation to determine the legitimacy of this connection."
